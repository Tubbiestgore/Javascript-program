# Overview

This Repository is a series of small projects designed to devlope my undrestanding of the Javascript language. In the JAVASCRIPT.md file
I cover in depth some of the topics which I had the opprotunity to work on while developing in this language. I also provide links and 
videos I found useful while in pursuit of that goal. Through this I hoped to increase my understanding of working with Libraries, understanding how recursion works in this language, and the usefulness of ES6 funtcions, amongst other things.

* Hello World Test: Basic test to output Hello World to the terminal.
* The Grocery Store: A progarm taht utilizes recursion in order to work through a line of people at the grocery store.
* Most Wanted List: A demonstartion of an ES6 function, utilized to find a criminal. More ES6 functions listed int he JAVASCRIPT.md file.
* Currency Converter: A program which utilizes a installed package/library in order to converter between currencies. 
* JAVASCRIPT.md: A documentation of everything that I have learned in the pursuit of these Javascript projects, one of my orignal goals.

My purpose as stated above, was to further my undrestanding of the fundamentals of Javascript, as well as some advanced concpets as captured in these several programs and documentation.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with a link below to install Node.js thereon. I also used Node.js in order to write outside of .Html, and I also utilized a lot of differnt sites in order to get a bit of a crash course in the language.

The progarmming language that I used was Javascript. Javascript is particularly utilize in the Web Devlopment arena, and considered to be a versatile and dynamic language. The Library that I used was a currency converter, which can be found here:
* [Currency Converter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/currency-converter-lt?activeTab=readme)

For the main project I used this API in order to get the current exchange data.
* [ExchangeRateAPI](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)

# Future Work

A short list of things that I can do in the future, when I come back to this project.

- Make it so that the currency converter can do more than just Euro's and USD.
- Learn more about .Html as well as .css.
- I could perhaps make a more funcitonal webpage with better design.
- Go into more depth with API's
