# JavaScript: A Brief step into a Versatile Programming Language

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a versatile and widely-used programming language that has become a cornerstone of modern web development. Known for its unique characteristics and widespread adoption, JavaScript plays a pivotal role in creating interactive and dynamic web applications. Here I hope to clarify certain unique aspects of the language and how you can get started with your own projects! 

## Node.js

In essence, Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside of web browsers. Yes, Javascript can be executed directly in web browsers, however for this particular projecct, I decided to use Node.Js. However, the benefit to coding in Javascript outside of a web browser is that it extends Javascripts capabilities. It allows for file I/O, network communication, and much more. Below I will provide a link to the Node.js download as well as a video tutorial for how to install it on Visual Studio Code. For purposes of this project, I will only be going into detail about this style of Javascript.

## Syntax

JavaScript's syntax is similar to many C-style languages, making it relatively easy to learn for those familiar with programming concepts. It uses semicolons to terminate statements, curly braces to define blocks of code, and is case-sensitive as examples of its similarities. Here is an example of code:

```JS
function computerGreet(userInput) 
{
    console.log("Hello", userInput);
}

const userInput = prompt("What is your name?");
console.log(computerGreet(userInput))
```

Above we have a simple funciton demonstrating a few things about this language. We have functions that take parameters, like other languages. In order to print to the console we use "console.log" in order to get an output to the terminal. We also notice that the variable is being declared as a constance "const", there are many different ways to declare variables. Hwoever, as stated above, this language is an awful lot like C. Below I have provided some useful links to the syntax of this language.
